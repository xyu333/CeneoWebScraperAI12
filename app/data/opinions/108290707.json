        "content": "In a casing resembling a small printer, there is a multifunction device that has printing, scanning and copying functions. And it is precisely the small size and compactness that are the greatest advantages of the HP DeskJet 3762. The device does not take up much space and is therefore ideal for home use, where we do not have a separate office room, but only a corner for work. Another advantage is certainly the price. In this price range, it is difficult to find a device with such parameters and such efficiency. The quality of the prints is also a positive surprise, although it must be honestly admitted that it is not a speed demon. Another advantage is also wireless printing, which in itself is a very practical solution, and in the HP DeskJet 3762 it works flawlessly. The quality of workmanship is okay, the design is a matter of taste, but it would be nice if there was a choice of colors - turquoise will not appeal to everyone. To sum up, I recommend the device to everyone for home use.",

Besides, there is no point in buying this printer for larger printing because you can go bankrupt on inks. The original one XL ink, which is for 300 pages (supposedly, I don't print that much on one ink) costs 110 PLN. I buy 4 inks a month. I had a toner printer with a toner and I bought it for 30 PLN and it worked for a long time. I got excited about a small printer and it is not worth it. It is slow, loud and terribly expensive to use. I have to sell it and buy another one with toner.",
